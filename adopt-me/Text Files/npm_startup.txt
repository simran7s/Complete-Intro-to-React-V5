1) `npm init` (initialized a json file)
2)Installing npm dependencies using
    `npm install -D _______` -D is when you want the dependency to only be installed for your local machine, for you wont need it when exporting for deployment

    'npm i -D prettier' also works

3) Whenever we install a dependency it gets added in the package.json under `"devDependencies":`

4) installing the dependency we jsut got. Example for us is prettier. We need to add to the scripts in package.json

    "format": "prettier \"src/**/*.{js,html}\" --write",

    this will format all js and html files and write(edit the text) them in the same way using prettier

5) Change settings and install prettier through vsCode Extensions. 

    check `Prettier: require config`

    this makes it so that Prettier only runs on files that have prettier installed on it through NPM the way we did it above



6) Create file in root called ".prettierrc" inside just write `{}` this is have it so when using prettier we will just have the default settings

7) we will install eslint and eslint-config-prettier
    `npm i -D eslint eslint-config-prettier`

    eslint checks the styling and makes sure we are using proper styles with js the correct js methods etc, (checks for not having unused vars, using old constructs etc)

    eslint-config-prettier says to eslint to not worry about the tabs and spacing and just let prettier handle that stuff


8. create a eslintrc.json file in root

        `
        {
        "extends": ["eslint: recommended", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
        "plugins": [],
        "parserOptions": {
            "ecmaVersion": 2018,
            "sourceType": "module",
            "ecmaFeatures": {
            "jsx": true
            }
        },
        "env": {
            "es6": true,
            "browser": true,
            "node": true
        }
        }

        `

        parserOptions: it tells it to use es6 constructs, modules allows us to use import export, etc etc

9. Add another script in package.json

    `
    "lint": "eslint \"src/**/.{js,jsx}\" --quiet",
    `

    ... still cant run because we gotta define React in app.js
